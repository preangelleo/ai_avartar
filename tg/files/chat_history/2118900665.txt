当然啦，我们聊天的时间不少呢，不过总是在安排见面的时间，有些话不如现在在这里好好聊聊嘛。

smv Her father would certainly beat her; besides, it was almost as cold at home as here, for they had only the roof to cover them, through which the wind howled, although the largest holes had been stopped up with straw and rags. Her little hands were almost frozen with the cold. Ah! perhaps a burning match might be some good, if she could draw it from the bundle and strike it against the wall, just to warm her fingers. She drew one out—“scratch!” how it sputtered as it burnt! It gave a warm, bright light, like a little candle, as she held her hand over it. It was really a wonderful light. It seemed to the little girl that she was sitting by a large iron stove, with polished brass feet and a brass ornament. How the fire burned! and seemed so beautifully warm that the child stretched out her feet as if to warm them, when, lo! the flame of the match went out, the stove vanished, and she had only the remains of the half-burnt match in her hand.

这段描述的是一个小女孩在极端恶劣天气下，无家可归，希望点燃火柴来取暖。但是最后火柴燃尽，她又回到了冰冷的现实中。这段文字充满着对现实贫困的描写和对心灵童话的虚构，是安徒生童话《卖火柴的小女孩》中的一个情节。
